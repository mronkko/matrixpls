  Abstract = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) has become a quasi-standard in marketing and management research when it comes to analyzing the cause-effect relations between latent constructs. For most researchers, SEM is equivalent to carrying out covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM). While marketing researchers have a basic understanding of CB-SEM, most of them are only barely familiar with the other useful approach to SEM-partial least squares SEM (PLS-SEM). The current paper reviews PLS-SEM and its algorithm, and provides an overview of when it can be most appropriately applied, indicating its potential and limitations for future research. The authors conclude that PLS-SEM path modeling, if appropriately applied, is indeed a "silver bullet" for estimating causal models in many theoretical models and empirical data situations.

  Abstract = {Every discipline needs to frequently review the use of multivariate analysis methods to ensure rigorous research and publications. Even though partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is frequently used for studies in strategic management, this kind of assessment has only been conducted by Hulland (1999) for four studies and a limited number of criteria. This article analyzes the use of PLS-SEM in thirty-seven studies that have been published in eight leading management journals for dozens of relevant criteria, including reasons for using PLS-SEM, data characteristics, model characteristics, model evaluation and reporting. Our results reveal several problematic aspects of PLS-SEM use in strategic management research, but also substantiate some improvement over time. We find that researchers still often do not fully make use of the method's capabilities, sometimes even misapplying it. Our review of PLS-SEM applications and recommendations on how to improve the use of the method are important to disseminate rigorous research and publication practices in the strategic management discipline.},

	Abstract = {Partial least squares path modeling (PLS) was developed in the 1960s and 1970s as a method for predictive modeling. In the succeeding years, applied disciplines, including organizational and management research, have developed beliefs about the capabilities of PLS and its suitability for different applications. On close examination, some of these beliefs prove to be unfounded and to bear little correspondence to the actual capabilities of PLS. In this article, we critically examine several of these commonly held beliefs. We describe their origins, and, using simple examples, we demonstrate that many of these beliefs are not true. We conclude that the method is widely misunderstood, and our results cast strong doubts on its effectiveness for building and testing theory in organizational research.},

  Abstract = {In marketing applications of structural equation models with unobservable variables, researchers have relied almost exclusively on LISREL for parameter estimation. Apparently they have been little concerned about the frequent inability of marketing data to meet the requirements for maximum likelihood estimation or the common occurrence of improper solutions in LISREL modeling. The authors demonstrate that partial least squares (PLS) can be used to overcome these two problems. PLS is somewhat less well-grounded than LISREL in traditional statistical and psychometric theory. The authors show, however, that under certain model specifications the two methods produce the same results. In more general cases, the methods provide results which diverge in certain systematic ways. These differences are analyzed and explained in terms of the underlying objectives of each method.},

  Abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical overview and empirical demonstration of Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS) comparing it to Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The two data analysis techniques share historical origins but differ in terms of underlying algorithms, which gives rise to other key differences: (a) the treatment of unexplained indicator variance; (b) the specification of formative constructs; (c) the availability of model fit estimates; and (d) sample size requirements. We conduct secondary analyses of an existing data set from MacCann, Fogarty, and Roberts (2012) as an empirical demonstration of the utility of PLS in psychology research. The first analysis shows PLS will produce results similar to those of SEM for a simple mediation model. The second analysis shows that PLS can produce results for a complex model for which SEM would require a prohibitively large sample. We conclude that: (1) under common constraints of differential psychology research settings, sample size requirements of PLS may be substantially smaller than those of SEM; (2) PLS is a useful tool for differential psychology research in scenarios where sample size constrains the use of robust SEM; and (3) that PLS offers a viable means to explore and text complex models beyond current limits.},

	Abstract = {Partial least squares path modeling (PLS) has been increasing in popularity as a form of or an alternative to structural equation modeling (SEM) and currently has considerable momentum in some management disciplines. Despite recent criticism of the method, most studies that have analyzed the performance of PLS have reached positive conclusions. In this paper, I show that most of the evidence of the that has been used to support the usefulness of the method has actually been misinterpreted. My analysis shows that PLS amplifies the effects of chance correlations in a unique way and that this effect explains prior simulation results better than previous interpretations. It is inconceivable that a researcher would willingly amplify error, such that the results show that the usefulness of the PLS method is a fallacy. There are much better ways to compensate for the attenuation effect caused by using latent variable scores to estimate SEM models than creating a bias in the opposite direction.},

  Abstract = {Social scientists often estimate models from correlational data, where the independent variable has not been exogenously manipulated; they also make implicit or explicit causal claims based on these models. When can these claims be made? We answer this question by first discussing design and estimation conditions under which model estimates can be interpreted, using the randomized experiment as the gold standard. We show how endogeneity -- which includes omitted variables, omitted selection, simultaneity, common-method variance, and measurement error -- renders estimates causally uninterpretable. Second, we present methods that allow researchers to test causal claims in situations where randomization is not possible or when causal interpretation could be confounded; these methods include fixed-effects panel, sample selection, instrumental variable, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-differences models. Third, we take stock of the methodological rigor with which causal claims are being made in a social sciences discipline by reviewing a representative sample of 110 articles on leadership published in the previous 10 years in top-tier journals. Our key finding is that researchers fail to address at least 66\% and up to 90\% of design and estimation conditions that make causal claims invalid. We conclude by offering 10 suggestions on how to improve non-experimental research.},

	Abstract = {When it was originally introduced, Partial Least Squares (PLS) was designed primarily for exploratory studies focusing on prediction (rather than hypothesis testing). Over time, however, PLS has become a very popular statistical analysis technique for testing hypothesized relationships (confirmatory studies) within MIS research. In this paper we note some challenges that have been raised relative to PLS, and then focus on four assertions concerning its use that we believe are problematic. We show that these frequently stated assertions of PLS strength actually suggest important weaknesses. In particular, we show evidence that PLS seems to capitalize on chance correlations among indicators at sample sizes typically used in MIS research. Our belief is that many PLS users are unaware of the trade-offs involved in PLS use, and we recommend a much reduced (or possibly non-existent) role for PLS in confirmatory work.},

@book{hwang_generalized_2014,
	Abstract = {Developed by the authors, generalized structured component analysis is an alternative to two longstanding approaches to structural equation modeling: covariance structure analysis and partial least squares path modeling. Generalized structured component analysis allows researchers to evaluate the adequacy of a model as a whole, compare a model to alternative specifications, and conduct complex analyses in a straightforward manner.  Generalized Structured Component Analysis: A Component-Based Approach to Structural Equation Modeling provides a detailed account of this novel statistical methodology and its various extensions. The authors present the theoretical underpinnings of generalized structured component analysis and demonstrate how it can be applied to various empirical examples. The book enables quantitative methodologists, applied researchers, and practitioners to grasp the basic concepts behind this new approach and apply it to their own research.  The book emphasizes conceptual discussions throughout while relegating more technical intricacies to the chapter appendices. Most chapters compare generalized structured component analysis to partial least squares path modeling to show how the two component-based approaches differ when addressing an identical issue. The authors also offer a free, online software program (GeSCA) and an Excel-based software program (XLSTAT) for implementing the basic features of generalized structured component analysis.},

While maintaining all the strengths of PLS, the consistent version provides two key improvements. Path coefficients, parameters of simultaneous equations, construct correlations, and indicator loadings are estimated consistently. The global goodness-of-fit of the structural model can also now be assessed, which makes PLS suitable for confirmatory research. A Monte Carlo simulation illustrates the new approach and compares it with covariance-based structural equation modeling.},

	Abstract = {Partial Least Squares as applied to models with latent variables, measured indirectly by indicators, is well-known to be inconsistent. The linear compounds of indicators that PLS substitutes for the latent variables do not obey the equations that the latter satisfy. We propose simple, non-iterative corrections leading to consistent and asymptotically normal (CAN)-estimators for the loadings and for the correlations between the latent variables. Moreover, we show how to obtain CAN-estimators for the parameters of structural recursive systems of equations, containing linear and interaction terms, without the need to specify a particular joint distribution. If quadratic and higher order terms are included, the approach will produce CAN-estimators as well when predictor variables and error terms are jointly normal. We compare the adjusted PLS, denoted by PLSc, with Latent Moderated Structural Equations (LMS), using Monte Carlo studies and an empirical application.},

The weights that are used in practice can be different (differential weights) or equal (unit weights). Relevant literature across multiple disciplines and multiple decades is reviewed. The literature indicates that unit weights have substantial predictive validity when compared with regression weights, but there is a lack of data on how other differential weighting strategies (e.g., weights generated by subject matter experts) compare to unit weights. In response, a primary and a meta-analytic study are provided here. The recent literature also contains some potential criticisms of unit weights in regard to personnel selection and content validation---and those statements are evaluated. The data and findings indicate that unit weights can be a highly appropriate approach for weighting under many circumstances.},

@article{hwang_comparative_2010,
	Abstract = {Traditionally, two approaches have been employed for structural equation modeling: covariance structure analysis and partial least squares. A third alternative, generalized structured component analysis, was introduced recently in the psychometric literature. The authors conduct a simulation study to evaluate the relative performance of these three approaches in terms of parameter recovery under different experimental conditions of sample size, data distribution, and model specification. In this study, model specification is the only meaningful condition in differentiating the performance of the three approaches in parameter recovery. Specifically, when the model is correctly specified, covariance structure analysis tends to recover parameters better than the other two approaches. Conversely, when the model is misspecified, generalized structured component analysis tends to recover parameters better. Finally, partial least squares exhibits inferior performance in parameter recovery compared with the other approaches. In particular, this tendency is salient when the model involves cross-loadings. Thus, generalized structured component analysis may be a good alternative to partial least squares for structural equation modeling and is recommended over covariance structure analysis unless correct model specification is ensured.

These procedures account for the best practices that the new framework identifies.

	abstract = {This article addresses Rönkkö and Evermann’s criticisms of the partial least squares (PLS) approach to structural equation modeling. We contend that the alleged shortcomings of PLS are not due to problems with the technique, but instead to three problems with Rönkkö and Evermann’s study: (a) the adherence to the common factor model, (b) a very limited simulation designs, and (c) overstretched generalizations of their findings. Whereas Rönkkö and Evermann claim to be dispelling myths about PLS, they have in reality created new myths that we, in turn, debunk. By examining their claims, our article contributes to reestablishing a constructive discussion of the PLS method and its properties. We show that PLS does offer advantages for exploratory research and that it is a viable estimator for composite factor models. This can pose an interesting alternative if the common factor model does not hold. Therefore, we can conclude that PLS should continue to be used as an important statistical tool for management and organizational research, as well as other social science disciplines.},

	abstract = {We study several aspects of bootstrap inference for covariance structure models based on three test statistics, including Type I error, power and sample-size determination. Specifically, we discuss conditions for a test statistic to achieve a more accurate level of Type I error, both in theory and in practice. Details on power analysis and sample-size determination are given. For data sets with heavy tails, we propose applying a bootstrap methodology to a transformed sample by a downweighting procedure. One of the key conditions for safe bootstrap inference is generally satisfied by the transformed sample but may not be satisfied by the original sample with heavy tails. Several data sets illustrate that, by combining downweighting and bootstrapping, a researcher may find a nearly optimal procedure for evaluating various aspects of covariance structure models. A rule for handling non-convergence problems in bootstrap replications is proposed.},
