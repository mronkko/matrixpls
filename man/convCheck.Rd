\title{Convergence checks}
\usage{
convCheck.relative(Wnew, Wold)

convCheck.square(Wnew, Wold)

convCheck.absolute(Wnew, Wold)
}
\arguments{
\item{Wnew}{Current weight matrix}

\item{Wold}{Weight matrix from the previous iteration}
}
\value{
Scalar value of the convergence criterion
}
\description{
The convergence check functions compare two weight matrices and returns the value of the
convergence criterion describing the difference between the two weight matrices.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{convCheck.relative()}: maximum of relative differences between
weights from two iterations

\item \code{convCheck.square()}: maximum of squared absolute 
differences between weights from two iterations.

between weights from two iterations
