\usage{
\method{residuals}{matrixpls}(object, ..., observed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{matrixpls estimation result object produced by the \code{\link{matrixpls}} function.}

\item{...}{All other arguments are ignored.}

\item{observed}{If \code{TRUE} (default) the observed residuals from the outerEstim.model regressions
(indicators regressed on composites) are returned. If \code{FALSE}, the residuals are calculated
by combining  \code{inner}, \code{reflective}, and \code{formative} as a simultaneous equations
system and subtracting the covariances implied by this system from the observed covariances.
The error terms are constrained to be uncorrelated and covariances between exogenous observed
values are fixed at their sample values.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements: \code{inner}, \code{outer}, and \code{indices} elements
containing the residual covariance matrix of regressions of composites on other composites,
the residual covariance matrix of indicators on composites, and various indices
calculated based on the residuals.
}
\description{
The \code{matrixpls} method for generic function \code{residuals} computes the residual
covariance matrix and various fit indices.
}
\details{
The residuals can be
either observed residuals from the regressions of indicators on composites and composites 
on composites
(i.e. the \code{reflective} and \code{inner} models) as presented by Lohmöller (1989, ch 2.4) or 
model implied residuals calculated by subtracting model implied covariance matrix from the 
sample covariance matrix as done by Henseler et al. (2014). 

The root mean squared residual indices (Lohmöller, 1989, eq 2.118) are calculated from the
off diagonal elements of the residual covariance matrix. The
standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) is calculated based on the standardized residuals
of the \code{reflective} model matrix. 

Following Hu and Bentler (1999, Table 1), the SRMR index is calculated by dividing with 
\eqn{p(p+1)/2}, where \eqn{p} is the number of indicator variables. In typical SEM applications,
the diagonal of residual covariance matrix consists of all zeros because error term variances
are freely estimated. To make the SRMR more comparable with the index produced by 
SEM software, the SRMR is calculated by summing only the squares of off-diagonal elements,
which is equivalent to including a diagonal of all zeros. 

Two versions of the 
SRMR index are rovided, the traditional SRMR that includes all residual covariances, and the 
version proposed by Henseler et al. (2014) where the within-block residual covariances are 
ignored.
