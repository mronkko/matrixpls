\title{Sign change corrections for bootstrap}
\usage{
signChange.individual(Worig, W)

signChange.construct(Worig, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{Worig}{The original weight matrix.}

\item{W}{a Weight matrix of a bootstrap sample.}
}
\value{
A weight matrix with the same dimensions as \code{W} after applying the correction.
}
\description{
These functions selectively reverse the signs of the weights in boostrap samples to be consistent 
with the weights calculated based on the original sample.
}
\details{
Sign change corrections are a controversial and inconsistently implemented feature in PLS analysis.
The two corrections described in the literature are the individual sign chance correction and the
construct level sign chance corrections.
The individual correction changes the signs of \code{W} to match \code{Worig}.

The construct level correction changes the signs of \code{W} on all rows where the sign of the
sum of the row differs between \code{Worig} and \code{W}.

The sign chance corrections are described ambiguosly and sometimes implemented inconsistently
between software. \pkg{matrixpls} implements the corrections by adjusting the weights before
calculating parameter estimates in each bootstrap replication. Some software implement the
correction post-hoc by adjusting the bootstrap estimates directly. Moreover, the 
literature present at least two different formulas for the construct level correction. 
\pkg{matrixpls} implements the version described by Tenenhaus et al. (2005).

The sign chance
corrections should not be confused with sign indeterminacy corrections applied to 
individual analyses
(See \code{\link{weightSign}}).
