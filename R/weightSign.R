#'Sign ambiguity corrections
#'
#'Sign ambiguity corrections adjust the signs of the weights to satisfy a criterion.
#'
#'Instead of fixing a weight to a particular value, composite variables are typically provided a
#'scale by standardization. This leads to sign indeterminacy because standardized weights \code{W}
#'and \code{-W} both satisfy the scaling constraint. The sing ambiguity corrections add additional
#'constraints that make 
#'
#'The sign indeterminacy
#'corrections should not be confused with sign chance corrections applied to boostrap samples 
#'(See \code{\link{signChange}}).
